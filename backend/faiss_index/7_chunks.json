baselined MON 25MMH Propulsion Design Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines What about MON 25MMH System  Historically nitric oxide was initially used as an inhibitor on nitrogen tetroxide propellant to resolve stress corrosion issues Adding 1 and then 3 of NO to NTO designated as MON 1 and MON 3 would reduce acceptable amount of iron nitrate in the oxidizer MON 25 is a mixture of NTO 75 and NO 25 MON 25 has a low freezing point and a similar freezing point of MMH Combustion characteristic and performance are similar to existing flight MON  3MMH Most of existing hyperlogic biprop components can be used for MON 25MMH propulsion Primary interest of MON 25 is its low freezing point Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Characteristics of MON 25 properties Low freezing point Increasing nitric oxide content to 25 MON 25 to depress the freezing point of the oxidizer Freezing temperature is changed from 13oC 9oF with 1 of NO added to the mixture down to 55oC 67oF when 25 of NO in the mixture Fuel MMH is frozen around 52oC 62oF similar to the one of MON25 There is a concern of NTO crystallization at low temperature MON25 should only be used in rocket engines at above 40oC 40oF Ignition delay was much lower than anticipated The ignition delay difference between the two hot fires at 20oC 68oF to 40oC 40oF was about 3 msec MON 25 for its hypergolic fuel companion MMH would be easy in the thermal management Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Characteristics of MON 25 properties Vaporization Vapor pressure of MON 25 is higher than MON 3 and mismatching with MMH Transferring liquid MON 25 must be performed under a pad pressure above 452 kPa66 psia and maintain this pressure level all time during the storage at the room temperature For a mission that the temperature may fluctuate due to the change in the space environments propulsion system of MON 25MMH can be susceptible and operate at a wider temperature swing than NTOMMH  Significant increase in the vapor pressure of MON 25 at the elevated temperatures can have repercussions with respect to tank design and the maximum design pressure of the system Isolated gaseous bubbles of MON 25 are formed The bubbles can be collapsed as traveling downstream This phenomena causes undesirable propellant flow oscillations that can lead to chamber pressure fluctuations MON 25MMH can be operated at wide temperature swing  however significant vapor pressure increase at an elevated temperature can have repercussions in system design Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Characteristics of MON 25 properties Viscosity the viscosity of the fluids would increase as the temperature reduces The change in viscosity of MON25 is gentle and behaves well In contrast the trend of MMH viscosity is similar to the one of MON 25 down to 0oC 32oF However as can be seen from the plot the rate of MMH viscosity drastically picks up when the temperature is below 0oC 32oF From the engine performance perspective drastic increase in viscosity from reducing temperature would cause a flow changing from turbulent regime to a laminar one through the injection orifices Rate of MMH viscosity drastically picks up when the temperature is below 0oC 32oF can be a challenge in engine design Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Summary Pros Mixing additional NO into NTO particularly with 25 of NO in mass results low freezing point for the mixture Subsequently using MON 25 for in space propulsion system would reduce heater power requirements and increase operation robustness Propulsion system of MON 25MMH is capably susceptible and operate at a wider temperature swing than NTOMMH Since both MON 25 and MMH have a similar freezing point around 50oC With a concern of NTO crystallization at low temperature MON 25 should only be used in rocket engines at above 40oC  40oF It was experimentally observed that engine has more quite soft start when the initial temperature of the engine and propellants are low High temperature behavior of MON 25 shows no anomalies and no pressure hysteresis was observed The diffusion rates of the vapors in the ullage space are rapid are enough to return into the liquid as temperature decreases Liquid ammonia has a relatively high vapor pressure compatible with MON 30 Engine hot fire tests show ammonia with lithium additives reacts hypergolically with MON 30 MON 25 may have more benefits of reducing the corrosiveness of materials than MON 3 since more NO content in the oxidizer would further reduce formulation of iron nitrate  Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Summary Cons Significant increase in the vapor pressure of MON 25 at the elevated temperatures can have repercussions with respect to tank design and the maximum design pressure of the system As liquid MON 25 flows through sharp curvature lines and abrupt geometries bubbles are formed due to local flow field pressure is dropped below the propellant vapor pressure This phenomena causes undesirable propellant flow oscillations that can lead to chamber pressure fluctuation Hot fire tests of engine indicates the ignition delay difference between 20oC 68oF and 40oC   40oF is about 3 msec It is much less than anticipated Most existing propulsion components have been used at normal benign temperature They may need to be re qualified or redesigned to accommodate for use in the low temperature environments Because of the low temperature more pressurant  such as helium would be required to pressurize propellant tanks as compared to systems at higher temperature Regarding MON 25MMH system a drastic increase of MMH viscosity when the temperature swing below 0oC 32oF would become challenging in system design Such a change in viscosity has strong effects on the propellant injection characteristics Assessment of MON 25MMH Propellant System for Deep Space Engines Conclusions For deepspace missions spacecraft often faces extreme temperature environments throughout its flight duration In comparison with its MON family such as widely used MON 1 and MON3 oxidizer MON25 can offer a capability of operating at lower temperature and a wider temperature range Subsequently MON25 benefits the reduction of heater power requirement and robustness in operation High vapor pressure of MON25 can hinder a desire of its use in a practical application especially for a mission on which a large environmental temperature swing is anticipated Although oxidizer MON25 and its companion fuel MMH have a similar freezing point an exponential increase in viscosity of MMH when reducing in temperature below 0oC 32oF poses a unique challenging in propulsion system and engine designs A way of overcoming these disadvantages is to operate the system at optimal pressure and to limit the temperature particularly at the low end of the temperature Overall a comprehensive trade study should be conducted when selecting MON25 as a propellant for spacecraft Depending missions MON25 can be attractive for certain missions while it may be not a great payoff for othersã€‚"]

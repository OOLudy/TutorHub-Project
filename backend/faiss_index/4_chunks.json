kilobyte \"kilo\" is the prefix Bytes are the smallest unit of data that can be stored in a computer so there needs to be a way of expressing bytes in larger multiples Denary prefixes A common way of expressing multiples of bytes is to use denary prefixes Denary unit Equivalent size bytes 1 kilobyte 1 KB 1000 1 megabyte 1 MB 1000000 1 gigabyte 1 GB 1000000000 1 terabyte 1 TB 1000000000000 1 petabyte 1 PB 1000000000000000 This system relies on the assumption that 1 kilo  1000 This assumption is based on the denary base 10 number system Eg a 1 GB hard drive can store 1 x 10 bytes Binary prefixes However computers use the binary base 2 number system so the denary system is technically inaccurate when describing storage To be precise expressing multiples of bytes is done using binary

binary Why does it matter The importance of the system being used depends on how precise you need to be Identifying the total amount of memory RAM available to a computer must be accurate use binary prefixes Eg 16 GiB RAM can store 16 x 2 bytes of data 17179869184 bytes when describing storage space a rough estimate is acceptable use denary prefixes Eg a 16 GB memory stick can store 16 x 10 bytes

of different digits or symbols a number system uses to represent values Each place in a number represents a power of the base starting from the right Denary Denary is a number system that is made up of 10 digits 09 Denary is referred to as a base10 number system Each digit has a weight factor of 10 raised to a power the rightmost digit is 1s 10  the next digit to the left 10s 10 and so on Humans use the denary system for counting measuring and performing maths calculations Using combinations of the 10 digits we can represent any number In this example 3 x 1000  2 x 100  6 x 10  8 x 1  3268 To represent a bigger number we add more digits Binary Binary is a number system that is made up of two digits 1 and 0 Binary is referred to as a base2 number system Each digit has a weight factor of 2 raised to a power the rightmost digit is 1s 2 the next digit to the left 2s 2 and so on Each time a new digit is added the column value is multiplied by 2 Using combinations of the 2 digits we can represent any number0 1 0 1Your notes  2025 Save My Exams Ltd Get more and ace your exams at savemyexamscom 4 In this example Binary 1100  1 x 8  1 x 4  12 To represent bigger numbers we add more

64 32 16 8 4 2 1 Then we start at the left and look for the highest number that is less than or equal to 101 and if so place a 1 in that column Otherwise place a 0 in the column 128 is bigger than 101 and therefore we place a 0 in that column 64 is smaller than 101 so we place a 1 in that column 101  64  37 This now means we have 37 left to find 32 is smaller than 37 so we place a 1 in that column 37  32  5 This now means we have 5 left to find 16 is bigger than 5 and therefore we place a 0 in that column 8 is bigger than 5 and therefore we place a 0 in that column 4 is smaller than 5 so we place a 1 in that column 5  1  1 This now means we have 1 left to find 2 is bigger than 1 and therefore we place a 0 in that column 1 is equal to the number we have left so we place a 1 in that

binary number in to a negative the positive binary number is inverted 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0  72Your notes  2025 Save My Exams Ltd Get more and ace your exams at savemyexamscom 10 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1  72 The issue with ones complement is that it can have two representations for 0 positive and negative What is twos complement Twos complement is another method of representing both positive and negative numbers To turn a positive binary number into a negative Positive binary number is inverted 1 is added to the right most bit Using twos complement the leftmost bit is designated the most significant bit MSB To represent negative numbers this bit must equal 1 turning the column value into a negative Working with 8 bits the 128 column becomes 128 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 0 1 0 0 1

to get the negative version you dont treat the MSB as negative like you would in twos complement Thats a different systemYour notes  2025 Save My Exams Ltd Get more and ace your exams at savemyexamscom 11 8 bit twos complement can represent values between 0111 1111 127 and 1000 0000 128 An alternative way of thinking about this is Starting from the right keep all the bits the same up to and including the first 1 Flip the rest of the digits 0101 1000 becomes 1010 1000 Key reasons to use twos complement Consistency You dont need different rules for signed and unsigned numbers Whether youre adding 37 and 58 or 37 and 58 or 37 and 58 the binary addition process is the same Twos complement works for any combination of positive and negative values Hardware simplicity CPUs are built to do simple binary addition Twos complement means The same adder circuit can handle everything No special logic is needed to detect signs or subtract manually It still works up to a point As long as the sum doesnt exceed the max value 127 in 8bit you can add two positive numbers with twos complement without any issues Worked Example Convert the denary number 649 into Binary Coded Decimal

summing numbers in base2 which uses only the digits 0 and 1 Like denary addition start from the rightmost digit and move towards the left Carrying over occurs when the sum of a column is greater than 1 passing the excess to the next left column Example addition Worked Example Add the following two binary integers using binary addition Show your working 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0  0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 Answer

the sum of two binary numbers exceeds the given number of bits In signed number representations the leftmost bit often serves as the sign bit overflow can flip this incorrectly changing the sign of the result Overflow generally leads to incorrect or unpredictable results as the extra bits are truncated or wrapped around Binary subtraction To carry out subtraction the number being subtracted is converted into its negative equivalent using twos complement The two numbers are then added together Example 48  12 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  48 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0  12 find twos complement of

of 0010 0100 denary equivalent of 36 which is the correct answer In twos complement arithmetic the overflow bit does not contribute to the actual value of the operation but is more of a byproduct of the methodYour notes  2025 Save My Exams Ltd Get more and ace your exams at savemyexamscom 15 Uses of Number Systems Applications of Binary Coded Decimal BCD What are the uses of binarycoded decimal BCD Use Case Why BCD is used Electronic calculators Keeps numbers in decimal format for easier display and accuracy Digital clocks and watches Time is naturally decimal eg 1245 so BCD makes display logic simpler Banking and financial systems Avoids rounding errors when doing decimal calculations especially with money Old digital systems  embedded systemsSimpler to implement with hardware that displays digits individually Binary coded decimal is commonly used in systems that need to display decimal numbers clearly and accurately BCD is ideal for applications like digital clocks calculators and financial systems where decimal precision matters Using BCD avoids rounding errors that can occur in binarybased arithmetic especially with money and time Its still found in older or embedded systems where simple hardwarebased decimal output is needed Applications of hexadecimal Why is hexadecimal used In Computer Science hexadecimal is often preferred when working with large values It takes fewer digits to represent a given value in hexadecimal than in binary 1 hexadecimal digit corresponds 4 bits and can represent 16 unique values 0F It is beneficial to use hexadecimal over binary because The more bits there are in a binary number the harder it makes for a human to read Numbers with more bits are more prone to errors when being copiedYour notes  2025 Save My Exams Ltd Get more

Character Encoding Character sets What is a character set A character set is all the characters and symbols that can be represented by a computer system Each character is given a unique binary code Character sets are ordered logically the code for B is one more than the code for A A character set provides a standard for computers to communicate and sendreceive information Without a character set one system might interpret 01000001 differently from another The number of characters that can be represented is determined by the number of bits used by the character set Two common character sets are American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII Universal Character Encoding UNICODE ASCII What is ASCII ASCII is a character set and was an accepted standard for information interchange ASCII uses 7 bits providing 2 unique codes 128 or a maximum of 128 characters it can represent This is enough to represent the letters numbers and symbols from a standard keyboard The sixth bit changes from 1 to 0 when comparing uppercase and lowercase characters a0110 0001 A0100 0001 b0110 0010 B 0100 0010 This made conversion between the two much easier This speeds up the overall usability

unique codes 2  256 or a maximum of 256 characters it can represent Extended ASCII provides essential characters such as mathematical operators and more recent symbols such as  This allows for nonEnglish characters and for drawing characters to be included UNICODE What is UNICODE UNICODE is a character set and was created as a solution to the limitations of ASCII UNICODE uses a minimum of 16 bits providing 2 unique codes 65536 or a minimum of 65536 characters it can represent UNICODE can represent characters from all the major languages around the world UNICODE was designed to create a universal standard that covered all languages and all writing systems The first 128 characters in the UNICODE character set are the same as ASCII ASCII vs UNICODE ASCII UNICODE Number of bits 7bits
